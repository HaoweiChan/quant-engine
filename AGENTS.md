# TAIFEX Algo Trading System — Agent Handbook

## Project Overview
Production quantitative trading system for TAIFEX Taiwan Index Futures (TX/MTX).
- **Instrument**: TX (full-size) and MTX (mini) contracts on TAIFEX
- **Timeframes**: 1m and 5m kbars; daily for regime detection
- **Session**: Night 15:00→05:00+1d, Day 08:45→13:45 (TAIFEX; DO NOT confuse with equities)
- **Infrastructure**: Python backend on netcup Germany server; React + Vite frontend + FastAPI backend
- **Broker API**: shioaji (Sinopac)

### Prod vs Dev environments

Two environments run side by side on the same server, sharing the DB:

| Env  | Frontend | Backend | Script                 | Branch rule |
|------|----------|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| Prod | `:5173`  | `:8000` | `scripts/run-prod.sh`  | **main only** — script refuses other branches |
| Dev  | `:5174`  | `:8001` | `scripts/run-dev.sh`   | any branch, with `--reload` and HMR |

Only launch the production site from the `main` branch. For any other
branch (feature work, hotfixes, experiments), use the dev runner. The
dev script refuses to bind production ports as a safety net.

## Core Architecture Invariants

These are non-negotiable. Any proposed change that violates one requires Orchestrator approval
and Risk Auditor sign-off before implementation begins.

1. **Policy pattern**: Every strategy = `EntryPolicy` + `AddPolicy/NoAddPolicy` + `StopPolicy`.
   Never embed signal logic directly in `PositionEngine`.

2. **Bar simulation**: Intra-bar stop checking is mandatory. Tick data not required.

3. **ATR split**: Daily ATR for stop-loss distances. Hourly ATR for pyramid add-triggers.
   Never use 1m ATR for stop placement — noise dominates.

4. **Anti-martingale pyramid**: `Size_k = Size_0 × γ^k`. Max loss is bounded by the
   initial stop distance regardless of how many levels are added.
   Pyramid configuration is NOT per-strategy — it is derived from the account-level
   `RiskLevel` (0–3) set in `EngineConfig.pyramid_risk_level`. The mapping function
   `pyramid_config_from_risk_level()` in `src/core/types.py` converts this to a
   `PyramidConfig`. Strategies must not define pyramid parameters in `PARAM_SCHEMA`.

5. **Session resets**: VWAP, ATR calibration windows, and OR windows must all respect
   TAIFEX session boundaries. Never carry these values across a session gap.
   The canonical session utility is `src/data/session_utils.py` — import from there,
   never hardcode session times elsewhere.

6. **Centralized indicators**: All reusable technical indicators live in `src/indicators/`.
   Each indicator module exposes a `PARAM_SPEC` dict defining its tunable parameters
   and bounds. Strategies import indicators from `src/indicators/` and use
   `compose_param_schema()` to inherit indicator parameter definitions into their
   `PARAM_SCHEMA`. Do not duplicate indicator math inside strategy files.

7. **Intraday strategies go flat at session close**: Any strategy operating on 1m or 5m
   bars must close all positions by the last bar of each session. No overnight or
   inter-session carries. This is enforced in the backtest engine and must be enforced
   in live execution. See the Intraday Position and Benchmark Rules section below.

---

## Intraday Position and Benchmark Rules

These rules apply to every strategy that trades on 1m or 5m bars. They are not optional.

### End-of-Session Flat Rule
All open positions must be closed at or before the last bar of each session:
- Night session: close by 04:59 (last 1m bar before 05:00)
- Day session: close by 13:44 (last 1m bar before 13:45)

This is implemented as a forced exit in the backtest engine's session-close handler.
In live trading, the Live Systems Engineer's order router must issue a market order
to flatten any open position when the session-close signal fires.

**Why this rule exists**: Holding overnight introduces gap risk that is structurally
different from the intraday risk the strategy was designed for. Carrying positions
across session boundaries also invalidates the session-scoped indicators (VWAP, OR)
and makes performance attribution ambiguous.

### Intraday Benchmark Definition
The correct benchmark for an intraday strategy is **not** buy-and-hold over the
full study period. It is the **intraday buy-and-hold**: buy the first bar of each
session, sell the last bar of the same session, repeat for every session in the
study period.

```
Intraday B&H return for session S:
  r_S = (close_of_last_bar_S - open_of_first_bar_S) / open_of_first_bar_S

Cumulative intraday B&H:
  product of (1 + r_S) for all sessions in the study period
```

This benchmark answers the question: "Could I have done better by just holding
the index for the same intraday windows my strategy was active?" It uses the
identical holding universe as the strategy — no overnight positions, no session
gap exposure — making it a fair comparison.

**What the standard buy-and-hold benchmark measures instead**: Total return including
overnight gaps, weekend gaps, and cross-session moves. An intraday strategy that
avoids bad overnight gaps will look worse against this benchmark than it deserves,
and a strategy that catches morning gaps will look better than it deserves.

### Reporting Requirement
Every backtest report must include both:
1. Strategy cumulative return and Sharpe
2. Intraday B&H cumulative return and Sharpe for the same sessions

The strategy's Sharpe must exceed the intraday B&H Sharpe to be considered
to have demonstrated edge. A strategy with lower Sharpe than intraday B&H is
not adding value over a passive intraday hold.

### Implementation in Backtest Engine
The simulator must compute the intraday benchmark automatically alongside strategy results:

```python
def compute_intraday_bnh(bars: list[Bar]) -> BenchmarkResult:
    """
    For each session in bars, compute open-to-close return.
    Combine across sessions as a daily return series.
    """
    sessions: dict[str, list[Bar]] = group_bars_by_session(bars)
    session_returns = []
    for sid, session_bars in sorted(sessions.items()):
        if len(session_bars) < 2:
            continue
        entry = session_bars[0].open
        exit_ = session_bars[-1].close
        session_returns.append((exit_ - entry) / entry)

    equity = np.cumprod([1 + r for r in session_returns])
    sharpe = annualized_sharpe(session_returns)
    return BenchmarkResult(
        label="Intraday B&H",
        cumulative_return=equity[-1] - 1,
        sharpe=sharpe,
        session_returns=session_returns,
    )
```

## MCP Tools Available

All agents with research or implementation tasks can call the backtest MCP server (17 tools total):

**Core backtesting**
- `run_backtest` — single path, quick parameter check on synthetic data
- `run_backtest_realdata` — backtest on real historical OHLCV from database
- `run_monte_carlo` — distributional robustness across N synthetic paths (prefer over single backtest)
- `run_parameter_sweep` — Optuna TPE Bayesian search with pruning (max 3 params per sweep, gates-aware)
- `run_stress_test` — tail scenarios: gap_down, flash_crash, vol_regime_shift, liquidity_crisis, slow_bleed

**Out-of-sample validation**
- `run_walk_forward` — expanding-window out-of-sample validation on real data (Phase 2 alpha proof)
- `run_sensitivity_check` — ±20% parameter perturbation analysis to detect overfitting (mandatory Stage 4 gate)

**Risk reporting**
- `run_risk_report` — unified 5-layer risk sign-off report (cost, sensitivity, regime MC, adversarial, walk-forward)

**Strategy file I/O**
- `read_strategy_file` — read strategy policy from registry (`__list__` returns all slugs)
- `write_strategy_file` — write/validate strategy policy with syntax checking
- `scaffold_strategy` — generate strategy boilerplate with correct Policy interfaces

**Parameter & run history**
- `get_parameter_schema` — call first in any optimization session, returns all param bounds + scenarios
- `get_run_history` — query persisted optimization runs across sessions
- `get_optimization_history` — session-local run history (avoid re-testing known combinations)
- `get_active_params` — retrieve currently active optimized parameters for a strategy
- `activate_candidate` — promote a parameter candidate to active status for live trading

**Strategy promotion**
- `promote_optimization_level` — advance a strategy to the next optimization level (L0→L1→L2→L3) with gate validation against holding-period-aware thresholds

### Default Cost Model

All backtest, Monte Carlo, parameter sweep, and stress test tools **automatically apply default transaction costs**:
- **TX**: 0.1% slippage + NT$100/round-trip commission
- **MTX**: 0.1% slippage + NT$40/round-trip commission

These defaults are injected automatically in the backtest engine (`_build_runner`). Users need not specify costs; costs are applied unless explicitly overridden. The cost model is configurable per instrument via `get_instrument_cost_config(symbol)` in `src/core/types.py`.

## Ablation Study & Start-from-Simple Protocol

Before optimizing any strategy with ≥ 3 indicators, run an ablation study.

**Start-from-simple**: Build incrementally — core signal only → add one indicator at a
time → keep only what helps (Sharpe +0.1 or MDD -2pp). Simpler strategies generalize
better out-of-sample.

**Ablation study**: For existing strategies, remove each indicator one at a time. If
removal IMPROVES performance, that indicator is harmful — remove it permanently.

**When required**:
- Before any L2 optimization attempt on a strategy with ≥ 3 indicators
- When a strategy fails L2 gates (MDD/Sharpe) — simplification often fixes what
  parameter tuning cannot
- When reviewing or inheriting another agent's strategy

The ablation report (table of configurations vs metrics) must be included in the
research report. The Risk Auditor verifies that every retained indicator is justified.

## Quality Gates

A strategy may not be promoted to live unless every item below passes.
These are checked and signed by the Risk Auditor. No exceptions.

**Simulation robustness (Phase 1)**
- MC P50 Sharpe ≥ 0.8 on `strong_bull`
- MC P50 Sharpe ≥ 0.4 on `sideways`
- MDD < 25% on `flash_crash`
- ±20% parameter perturbation causes < 30% Sharpe degradation
- Optimal parameters not at `min`/`max` boundary of their PARAM_SCHEMA range

**Historical alpha validation (Phase 2 — required for sign-off)**
- Walk-forward validation Sharpe ≥ 1.0 on real OHLCV bars (out-of-sample only)
- Strategy Sharpe exceeds intraday B&H Sharpe for the same sessions
- MDD ≤ 20% in any single validation window
- Win Rate 35%–70%
- N_trades ≥ 30 per validation window
- Both day session and night session validated separately
- Profit Factor ≥ 1.2

**Execution**
- +1 tick slippage per side applied: Sharpe still ≥ 0.5
- Paper trade 5 sessions: actual slippage ≤ 2× model
- End-of-session flat confirmed in paper trade logs

**Code**
- No look-ahead bias (Risk Auditor manual review)
- Session boundary resets verified
- `validate_engine()` passes
- Unit tests green

## Approach
- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read unless the file may have changed.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.
